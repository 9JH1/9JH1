I've been interested in computers all my life, I got into basic software development in 2015 where I learned the electron framework and how to use Pythons Flask as an IPC. I relised that in order to actually create software I'd have to learn some form of web language so I learnt all of the basic web languages until. After playing around with software development for a few years I decided to learn C in 2022 which is what I have stuck with since. Now-a-days I work on CLI projects and Customize my personal flavour of linux.
